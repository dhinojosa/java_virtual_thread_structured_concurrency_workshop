## 💡 Using Codespaces for This Workshop

We recommend GitHub Codespaces (4-core, 16 GB) to run Java, and Docker together. This is already configured for you.

**You do NOT need a credit card**.

The workshop runs ~8 hours, which uses about **32 core-hours**.
GitHub Free users get **120 core-hours per month**, so you’re good **unless you’ve used Codespaces earlier this month**.

## Before the workshop

Visit [https://github.com/settings/billing](https://github.com/settings/billing) to confirm you have enough core-hours.

If you run out midway, we’ll help you pair up or add you to a backup workspace or I can add you to my organization.
